# ZOMATO RESTAURANT ANALYSIS

## Description & Methods
This project was conducted for Zomato, a multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. Its goal was to understand the business performance of restaurants and customers by having analysts choose an area of focus to build a research plan around, conduct the analysis, and deliver conclusions and suggestions. The research area chosen was Restaurant analysis; learning, from the data, things like what restaurants are popular, which generate the highest revenue, and why.
  * After choosing the type of analysis, the first part of the project was to build a plan- deciding on the metrics and parameters for the investigation, how to structure the dashboard, and making a detailed decomposition.
The decomposition included:
    *   Questions: What restaurants are popular? What cuisines are popular? What restaurants generate the highest revenue? Why? What are the most profitable areas or restaurants?
    *   Hypothesis: The most popular and most profitable restaurants will have the biggest number of orders and highest sales amounts.
    *   Visualizations: a heatmap, a bar chart, and a scatterplot.
    *   Dashboard Assembly: The orders and restaurant tables will be combined using an Outer JOIN, specifically a LEFT JOIN through the ID and r_id fields.
  * A heatmap visualization was created with the measures being; the Month of Order Date, State, and Average Profit. After the three best combinations of month and state were determined, a return on ad spend formula was used to tally what Superstore's advertising budget should be. They wanted to spend no more than 1/5th of their profits on advertising.

## Findings
* The two biggest centers for profit and loss, each, and their respective categories were identified as the following: office supplies in California and Technology in New York, Technology in Ohio, and Office Supplies in Texas, respectively.
* An advertising budget was justified by identifying the 3 best combinations of states and months of the year to advertise in: Indiana during October, Vermont during November, and Washington during March. After running a return on ad spend ratio, and Superstore willing to pay 1/5 of advertising profits, respectively, the Superstore should be willing to pay the following: $128.62, $119.20, and $104.26.
* Through data visualization and calculated fields, both the products and customers with the highest return rates were determined. Based on the average profit against the average return rate on a dimension of State, Superstore was recommended for the continuation of business in Vermont as it had the highest ranking within the visualization measures.
