# E-COMMERCE USER ACTIVITY ANALYSIS

## Description & Methods
	The executive team is interested in understanding how well the website is converting product page views into purchases. to track cohort metrics month by month, conduct a cohort analysis.

  * After choosing the type of analysis, the first part of the project was to build a plan- deciding on the metrics and parameters for the investigation, how to structure the dashboard, and making a detailed decomposition.
The decomposition included:
    *   Questions: What restaurants are popular? What cuisines are popular? What restaurants generate the highest revenue? Why? What are the most profitable areas or restaurants?
    *   Hypothesis: The most popular and most profitable restaurants will have the biggest number of orders and highest sales amounts.
    *   Visualizations: a bubble map, a bar chart, and a scatterplot.
    *   Dashboard Assembly: The orders and restaurant tables will be combined using an Outer JOIN, specifically a LEFT JOIN through the ID and r_id fields.
  * Once the plan was completed, the construction of the visualizations and dashboard was next.
    * The first is a bubble map, created based on the sum of the sales quantity of each restaurant.
    * The second is a simple bar chart that compares the sales amount of each restaurant.
    * The last is a scatter plot that factors in the number of orders versus the sales amount($) of the restaurants.
  * Finally, the dashboard assembled contains all three visualizations that adjust to each others' filtered settings. The dashboard shows the bigger picture within the data as well as any specifics within.

## Findings
* The business analysis found that 10.34% of product page views convert to purchases, which is considered a good conversion rate, generally speaking.
* It was also found that retention rates are the highest in the cohort from '2020-09', and remain so for the longest time between all six cohort groups. While looking at the cohort analysis values can make it seem that the '2020-09' cohort has the least amount of conversions, only when you calculate the retention rates can you see what the numbers are really saying.
