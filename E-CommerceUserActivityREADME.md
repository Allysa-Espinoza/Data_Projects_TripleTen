# E-COMMERCE USER ACTIVITY ANALYSIS

## Description & Methods
The executive team of the E-commerce company is interested in understanding how well the website  converts product page views into purchases. Exploring the raw transaction logs in their data shows each row represents an activity, or event, by a user on the company’s website. Each time a user views a product page, opens their shopping cart, or completes a purchase, the event is captured in the activity logs. With this, the project was divided into four main parts:
### 1. Building a conversion funnel
   - to better understand how users interact with the website
### 2. Preparing data for cohort analysis
   - build acquisition cohorts
  #### Filtered purchases

## Findings
* The business analysis found that 10.34% of product page views convert to purchases, which is considered a good conversion rate, generally speaking.
* It was also found that retention rates are the highest in the cohort from '2020-09', and remain so for the longest time between all six cohort groups. While looking at the cohort analysis values can make it seem that the '2020-09' cohort has the least amount of conversions, only when you calculate the retention rates can you see what the numbers are really saying.
